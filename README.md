# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

Welcome to the **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** repository! This project focuses on building a robust ASR system capable of transcribing spoken language into text. The implementation utilizes deep learning techniques and is designed to be modular and easily extendable.

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the following key components for building an ASR system:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tools and scripts to preprocess audio data for training and evaluation.
2. **Model Architecture:** Fine Tuning of various deep learning models for speech recognition.
3. **Training Pipeline:** Scripts to train the ASR models on the prepared datasets.
4. **Inference and Evaluation:** Tools to evaluate model performance on unseen audio samples.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Preprocessing
This component includes scripts for loading, normalizing, and segmenting audio data. It prepares the dataset for training by extracting relevant features.
### 2. Training Pipeline
The training pipeline consists of scripts to train the ASR models using the prepared datasets. It includes options for configuring hyperparameters and saving model checkpoints.

### 3. Inference and Evaluation
This component includes scripts for running inference on audio samples and evaluating model performance using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER).
