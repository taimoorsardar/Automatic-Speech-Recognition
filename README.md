## Project Overview

This repository contains the following key components for building an ASR system:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tools and scripts to preprocess audio data for training and evaluation.
2. **Model Architecture:** Implementation of various deep learning models for speech recognition, including CNNs and RNNs.
3. **Training Pipeline:** Scripts to train the ASR models on the prepared datasets.
4. **Inference and Evaluation:** Tools to evaluate model performance on unseen audio samples.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Preprocessing
This component includes scripts for loading, normalizing, and segmenting audio data. It prepares the dataset for training by extracting relevant features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

### 2. Model Architecture
This project implements various models suitable for ASR tasks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The models are designed to handle sequential data effectively.

### 3. Training Pipeline
The training pipeline consists of scripts to train the ASR models using the prepared datasets. It includes options for configuring hyperparameters and saving model checkpoints.

### 4. Inference and Evaluation
This component includes scripts for running inference on audio samples and evaluating model performance using metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER).
